   Equestrian is the latest sport to confirm its line-up for the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Following in the recent footsteps of handball and women’s football, the three equestrian disciplines – dressage, jumping and eventing – have seen all their berths allocated, the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) has confirmed. 
The places are allocated to National Olympic and Paralympic Committees, who decide whether to use the quotas and which athletes to send.
Six nations will be making debuts at Rio 2016: Chinese Taipei and Qatar in jumping, the Dominican Republic and Palestine in dressage, Zimbabwe in eventing, and Uruguay in the Paralympic equestrian competition, which is dressage only.
A total of 43 nations will compete in the Olympic equestrian events, while 30 countries will be represented in the Paralympic events.
“We are thrilled to be welcoming new nations to the Olympic and Paralympic equestrian family,” said FEI President Ingmar De Vos. “The Olympic and Paralympic Games are the pinnacle of our sport and we are looking forward to absolutely top-class equestrian action during both Games.”
